<div class="AboutUs">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The San Jacinto Rescue Center (SJRC) was formed in 2002 by a group of students with a shared concern for both animal welfare and the public health. 
Since opening our doors, we have remained true to our mission of helping all animals in need, regardless of species or breed. 
At our Shelter, we care for and find permanent, loving homes for dogs, cats and other companion animals. 
We have no time limit on an animal's stay with us - we keep all healthy and friendly companion animals until they are adopted. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Open Door policy means that no animal is ever refused shelter. 
We take in approximately 13,000 animals annually, and 15% of our animals came to us because they were turned away from limited admission shelters. 
As an Open Door Shelter, our presence is critical to the community. 
Without us, sick or injured animals would be left to suffer needlessly and dangerous animals would be left loose to roam the streets.
